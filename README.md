# CarpoolDiem 
In an attempt to make commuting more sustainable, here we will attempt to devise an algorithm to devise the optimal carpooling partners for each memer of a community. 

1. [Modeling workplace <=> homeowner spatial relations](https://github.com/michaelsilverstein/CarpoolDiem/blob/master/SyntheticData.ipynb)
>Here we generate synthetic data to mimic the spatial arrangement of homes and workplaces in the most simple of cases. The goal is to use an overly simplistic synthetic dataset to develop an algorithm that can then be applied to real geospatial data with driving time estimates from Google Maps API.
